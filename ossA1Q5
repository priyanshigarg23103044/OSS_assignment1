Simple C Calculator
This is a basic calculator program written in C that performs four arithmetic operations:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Program Structure and Flow
The program starts by displaying a menu listing the four operations.

The user is prompted to enter a number (1 to 4) corresponding to the desired operation.

According to the user’s choice, the program asks for two floating-point numbers.

It performs the selected arithmetic operation and prints the result formatted to two decimal places.

If the user enters a number outside the valid range (1–4), the program displays an error message.

Code Breakdown
Variables
int menu;
Stores the operation number entered by the user.

float num1, num2, result;
Used for the operands and the result. Floats allow decimal numbers.

Main Logic
Menu Display:
Printed with printf listing options 1 to 4.

Input:
Reads user’s operation choice using scanf("%d", &menu);

Switch Statement:
Executes different cases depending on menu:

Case 1 (Addition):
Prompts and reads two numbers, computes their sum, and prints the result.

Case 2 (Subtraction):
Prompts and reads two numbers, computes the difference, and prints the result.

Case 3 (Multiplication):
Prompts and reads two numbers, computes the product, and prints the result.

Case 4 (Division):
Prompts and reads two numbers, computes the quotient, and prints the result.
(Note: There is no division by zero check.)

Default:
Prints an error message if an invalid menu number is entered.

Limitations & Notes
No validation on numeric inputs; invalid inputs may cause unexpected behavior.

No check for division by zero, which can cause runtime errors.

The program runs once and exits immediately after one operation.
